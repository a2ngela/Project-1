# Project-1
This project explores a dataset on global coffee producers to analyze trends in coffee production. Using R, I investigated how factors like production year, rating, and altitude relate to the number of coffee bags produced. The analysis includes data visualizations created with ggplot2, formatted summary tables with kableExtra, and an HTML report generated through RMarkdown.
